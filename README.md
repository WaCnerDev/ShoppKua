# ShoppKua (Shopping Cart React with Vite)

This project is a shopping cart web application developed with React and Vite. It uses Context API for centralized state management of products and the cart. The structure includes reusable components, dedicated pages for the store and cart, and CSS styles.

This project originated as a final assignment for a course. As a personal challenge and to further my knowledge, I intend to add more features to it.
